Similarly to NLSE samplers, we'll have to parametrize this into an object that nicely allcoates parameter
spaces. These parameter spaces need to be visualized using t-SNE as well.

Then an updated, final sampler has to come to completion: Here we can have more variety in the spatial
nonlinearity m: any geometric pattern (stars, ellipses ...), discrete nonlinearity potentials,
GRF, GRF modulated with Morlet wavelets, "envelopes" (even though we're in real space.
