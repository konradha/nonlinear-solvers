- nicely refactor args to KGE 2d solvers, host and device (4x)
  -> make single driver for both 2d and 3d
- nicely refactor args to NLSE 2d solvers, host and device (4x)
  -> make single driver for both 2d and 3d

(for host/device each 2 drivers): 
  -> dimension as arg
  -> specs as args: L, n
  -> method 1: SV and SS2
  -> host / device

thus:
  - KGE_host_driver.cpp, KGE_dev_driver.cpp
  - NLSE_host_driver.cpp, NLSE_dev_driver.cpp

- adapt launchers correspondingly: Need 2d and 3d checks

- sanity-check solvers:
	- Krylov subspace host / device

	- step functions KGE
	- step functions NLSE
	  (both sufficient if test for 3d)
  -> should be thorough test cases showing that we're close up to an eps


- figure out nice factoring for u0, v0, (c,m) for KGE 2d
- figure out nice factoring for u0, v0, (c,m) for KGE 3d

- figure out nice factoring for u0, v0, (c,m) for NLSE 2d
- figure out nice factoring for u0, v0, (c,m) for NLSE 3d [STRETCH]
  -> might be difficult / infeasible depending on if solver actually works as expected

- collect 2TB for 3d cases // 5hrs
- collect 2TB for 2d cases // 10hrs -> need more phenomena to sample (have, just more runs)!

(should be doable tomorrow!)
