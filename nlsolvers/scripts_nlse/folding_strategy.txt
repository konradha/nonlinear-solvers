NLSE: (cubic, cubic-quintic, saturable)
Phenomena: [Phenomena]
Params: [3 / phenomenon]
spatial amplification: [constant (1), negative (-1),
    periodic-gaussians (+1.5), periodic-gaussians (-1.5), # periodic gaussians randomized ... 
    GRF, GRF neg] # fixed params here ...

entire fold makes: 3 x 10 x 3 x 6 = 1024 sample classes with each 1024 samples makes for
552960 trajectories generated

Let's do: cubic x phenomenon x param x m_type x 16 runs = 64 runs per class needed.
About 10k launches have to go thourgh for the entire sampling!

To reduce: Launch 4 runs per class. Still makes for rather large sample but can go through
much quicker.
